Description of the sds test case.

sds.c
-----

Version 0 is a common ancestor version of versions a and b.

Version a is a relatively new version from the git history, version b is slightly older.

For a full overview of the changes (which were not introduced for the purpose of this test) please run a diff command.
The biggest change is the change of a number of types from int to ssize_t.

The following problems are expected:
  - In sdsRemoveFreeSpace function a new variable oldhrlen is introduced in place of a call. While no change exists
    between 0 and b, the algorithm does see this as a change as for the dependence algorithm only two versions are
    considered.
